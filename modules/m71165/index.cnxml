<para id="fs-idm212274608">Your goal in your venture is to achieve success—ideally, fairly quickly—but most successful entrepreneurs experience some failures along the way. While these setbacks can be discouraging, they provide lessons and experiences that can lead to eventual success. Whether a new business is a retail store, restaurant, hair salon, consulting company, tech firm, or manufacturing plant, the truth is that many businesses fail within the first couple of years. According to <term class="no-emphasis">Bloomberg</term>, only 20 percent of new businesses find success within their first eighteen months.<footnote id="fs-idm208175376">Eric T.

<para id="fs-idm227548704">Entrepreneurs recognize that failure is part of the success of being a business owner. <term>Business failure</term> is the ending of a business due to the lack of goal attainment, which can mean low levels of revenue and profits, or not meeting investors’ expectations. Business failure can result in the loss of assets—such as revenue, equipment, and capital—and can cause trauma for the business owner. However, these failures often help entrepreneurs improve the outcomes for their next business, as they have now learned valuable lessons that can be applied to new projects.</para>

<para id="fs-idm205723856">There are some common reasons for failure that often combine to end a business.

<title>Marketing Failure</title>
<para id="fs-idm232588544">Some of the most common failures result from marketing missteps.</para>
<list id="fs-idm226723760" list-type="bulleted">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Lack of differentiation of product or service</emphasis>. Creating or running a company with a me-too mentality and without a clear unique selling proposition or difference from other established businesses can be detrimental. Answering questions such as “Why should customers leave other companies to buy my product?” “What is a benefit I provide that no one else does?” and “If I open a yogurt parlor in a commercial area, what will help my business differentiate itself from all the other yogurt, ice cream, dessert, and fast food places?” can help create ways to be special rather than a me-too business. This also needs to be defined in your mission, within your products and their benefits, and a clearly defined <term class="no-emphasis">competitive advantage</term> that can be translated into a <term class="no-emphasis">superior value proposition</term>. The chapters on <link document="m71148">Entrepreneurial Marketing and Sales</link> and <link document="m71135">Identifying Entrepreneurial Opportunity</link> discuss competitive advantages and value propositions in more detail.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Missing the right customer</emphasis>. Not reaching the <term class="no-emphasis">target market</term> can lead to failure. Perhaps for your travel tour business, you targeted single people ages 18–34 who like to experience travel in a different way, but maybe your true target—the people who want to book your tours—are couples with children and those 50 and over. You would have sent out marketing communications to the wrong age group. Or, the right message is not being conveyed and your positioning is off, preventing you from connecting with your true consumer. Conducting <term class="no-emphasis">market research</term> as discussed in <link document="m71148">Entrepreneurial Marketing and Sales</link> and testing your communication with various targets can help better define your customer.</item>

<title>Management Failure</title>
<para id="fs-idm220121776">These are some typical management challenges that can prove detrimental.</para>
<list id="fs-idm218694304" list-type="bulleted">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Passion wanes or not the right business</emphasis>. Sometimes the reason a business fails is due to a simple reason: The founder has lost excitement over the business and is no longer interested in making it succeed. Other times, the problem may stem from not having the right focus or idea, which can come from a lack of awareness about trends in the market. Joel <term class="no-emphasis">Delgado</term>, a young entrepreneur who started El Paso’s first escape room called <term class="no-emphasis">El Paso Disaster Room 915</term> in 2015, developed this business with three of his friends right after college. Although the business was very well received by young people who wanted this new form of entertainment, a few years later, he decided to close down the business and pursue a career in teaching. His passion had waned. Sometimes, entrepreneurs get bored with their startup, but there are ways to keep the business exciting by changing the product offerings.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Fighting founders</emphasis>. Not agreeing over the strategies and direction of a business can deter companies from moving forward. If the founders are not working together and disagree too much, this can help dissolve the business quickly. Differing points of view can be healthy for a business, as these can bring other complementing perspectives, but when conflict doesn’t get resolved, it can be difficult to continue moving forward. Some business partners have found themselves ousted by their business partners because the relationships have suffered a deep strain. This happened to Steve <term class="no-emphasis">Jobs</term> in 1985 when he was let go by his own company. Often, it is difficult to assess when conflict will arise, so it is recommended that business partners work with people who have the same love for the business and its core values, even if they bring different strengths and temperaments to the table. This may reduce fights and sustain relationships. Having a contract in place that defines who is in charge of what part of the business, their compensation, and what happens if anyone departs, is a good way to ensure that the investment won’t be lost if partners decide to part ways.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Lack of planning</emphasis>. One of the surest roads to failure is to not have a business plan or marketing plan. Even using the lean startup method requires some sort of planning before embarking on the process. Planning helps business owners flesh out ideas and understand the business better. Following the <term class="no-emphasis">business plan</term> in <link document="m71176">Business Model and Plan</link> and the <term class="no-emphasis">marketing plan</term> in <link document="m71148">Entrepreneurial Marketing and Sales</link> can help solidify where the business is headed, whether its viable, and what resources are required to make it work. For example, imagine a business owner who opens a restaurant in an already-crowded market only to realize how much competition existed in the area. If the owner had researched and planned ahead, the venture could have been differentiated through the type of food offered, the location, or different promotional tactics to build clientele. Failure to plan in a situation like this can result in struggling to keep afloat and can lead to successive challenges. For example, the owner might raise prices to compensate for lower-than-expected revenue, but higher prices may drive away an already fragile customer base, and the venture may not be sustainable.</item>

<section id="fs-idm226592656">
<title>Financial Failure</title>
<para id="fs-idm212203456">Cash flow, debt, and capital are just some of the many financial factors that play a large role in startup success or failure.</para>
<list id="fs-idm227020720" list-type="bulleted">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Lack of cash</emphasis>. Lacking cash to operate the business can trample its operations and lead to a quick decline. If there is no <term class="no-emphasis">cash flow</term>, it can also indicate that perhaps the business model is not working. For example, consider our fictional restaurant owner. A lack of customers means a lack of cash flowing in as revenue. Loans can provide some assistance while working to build the clientele, but loans can go only so far. If the business doesn’t grow and develop a sustainable cash flow, its ability to operate will come to an end.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Too much debt</emphasis>. Significant <term class="no-emphasis">debt</term> can hurt a business because it needs to pay back its lenders. In the previous example, if the restaurant owner takes on too much debt, it may struggle to pay it back due to its lack of cash flow.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Lack of capital</emphasis>. Not having sufficient <term class="no-emphasis">capital</term> can deter the business from expanding or even from meeting customer demand. Having a clear business plan can help determine the financial requirements, which are the estimated sales and profits required for the successful attainment of goals. Financing for the business can come from an entrepreneur’s own savings, bank loans, investors, and even friends and family. Having the right funding to start or grow a business can make or break the business. For instance, our restaurant owner would need enough capital to invest in kitchen equipment, appliances, and furniture to start the business. Undercapitalization in a startup could shut the business down before it even gets up and running. Once the business is running, ensuring that financial goals are met through metrics such as sales and profits can help prevent shortages of cash flow, which is essential to keeping a business alive.</item>

<para id="fs-idm207939632"><term class="no-emphasis">Blockbuster</term>, an instant hit out of the gates in the 1980s, failed to innovate, or pivot its business model, and went out of business. The video store revolutionized the media and movie industry by displaying empty boxes of its titles on shelves categorized by genre (the VHS tapes were kept behind the counter) and keeping late hours for night owls and last-minute weekenders wanting to catch a flick. Using a computer system to track videos as they were rented, most of its profit was made by the fees charged for late movie returns. In 1987, the company was bought by Wayne <term class="no-emphasis">Huizenga</term>, an American entrepreneur who owned several businesses in different industries and who developed Blockbuster into a successful business by modeling <term class="no-emphasis">McDonald’s</term> approach. The enterprise grew from twenty locations to over 9,000 locations. Blockbuster was then acquired in 1993 by media giant <term class="no-emphasis">Viacom</term> in an intricate transaction. As streaming and related technology entered the market, Blockbuster failed to innovate by not making necessary pivots to its delivery of entertainment and so could not compete with new technology. Over the ensuing decade, it became more common to see Blockbuster stores with “store closing” banners, as shown in <link target-id="OSX_Eship_10_02_Blockbust"/>, than it did to see a thriving store. There were other reasons why Blockbuster failed. Embedded with the lack of technology was the lack of fostering a culture of creativity from all of its employees, which hindered innovation. It lacked visionary leadership. It needed a culture of collaboration and teamwork to facilitate communication with stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and upper administration. Finally, it closed all but one of its stores in 2013.<footnote id="fs-idm232763360">Jeanine Poggi. “Blockbuster’s Rise and Fall: The Long, Rewinding Road.” <emphasis effect="italics">TheStreet</emphasis>.

<title>Fear of Failure</title>
<para id="fs-idm232353376">Even the fear of failure can be enough to lead a business to fail. Fear can freeze entrepreneurs and force them into a corner instead of advancing their businesses; it can freeze them from reaching potential clients and being profitable. When companies struggle, the owners may experience many emotions, such as pain, grief, shame, humiliation, self-blame, anger, and hopelessness. Business failure is hard to separate from personal failure, as the business is often associated with the identity of the entrepreneur. Managing these emotions can help business owners heal and continue moving forward to their next business. Reaching out for help to a trusted mentor or therapist can help provide guidance in dealing with these feelings.</para>
<para id="fs-idm218817760">There are likewise many stories of entrepreneurs who, despite their fears, continued working toward their goal and were successful. They kept going, determined that fear would not run their lives. Tony <term class="no-emphasis">Robbins</term>, author and serial entrepreneur, says that people are afraid of failure because it is painful, and people try to avoid pain and suffering at all costs. “Failure,” he says, “is the ultimate loss.”<footnote id="fs-idm230057136">Team Tony. “Overcoming the Fear of Failure.” <emphasis effect="italics">Tony Robbins</emphasis>. n.d. https://www.tonyrobbins.com/stories/overcoming-fear-failure/</footnote> But overcoming fear doesn’t have to be painful if you understand it as a program or detrimental thinking running in your mind. People are hardwired to believe they are not good enough or can’t do it. These patterns can be embedded in people’s minds and can deter creativity and success.

</table>
<para id="fs-idm241932256">Fear of failure often stems from thoughts of inadequacy or a belief that you don’t have the experience and skills necessary to succeed, that you’re not smart enough, and so on. Thoughts like these can prevent a person from starting or advancing their business. Individuals with a high level of stress about failure tend to lack self-esteem, have anxiety, be perfectionists, and tend to avoid new or unfamiliar things at all costs.<footnote id="fs-idm242717584">Mind Tools Content Team. “Overcoming Fear of Failure.” <emphasis effect="italics">MindTools</emphasis>. n.d. https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/fear-of-failure.htm</footnote> Fortunately, these traits and behaviors can be controlled and conquered.</para>

<title>What Failure Teaches You</title>
<para id="fs-idm204405712">Some would argue that, in reality, failure does not exist. There is only perceived failure, or obstacles that can become steps up the ladder to a better outcome. The importance in failing lies in learning how to get back up again. As Eric <term class="no-emphasis">Ries</term> dove into failure with his first company and felt the deep pain and disappointment of having to let go of an unsuccessful idea, he applied his lessons to create his new virtual reality company IMVU. <term class="no-emphasis">IMVU</term> then became a very successful experiment from which he derived the lean startup method. He was able to pinpoint his shortcomings and find ways to better himself and his performance. With his new company, he was able to get the product to market faster without it being perfect and ask for much-needed feedback from customers that he hadn’t received before.</para>

<title>Converting Lessons Learned to Success</title>
<para id="fs-idm243669008">Most successful business owners will tell you that success didn’t come to them easily. They had to persevere in pursuit of their goals to attain them. Converting their failures to lessons often led them to higher success than they had imagined. Entrepreneurs who can turn their obstacles into positive lessons can resurrect from failure.</para>
<para id="fs-idm203607840">Take Evan <term class="no-emphasis">Williams</term>, a visionary who launched a software tool to help users easily publish blogs. That venture, <term class="no-emphasis">Blogger.com</term>, was launched in 1999 and purchased by <term class="no-emphasis">Google</term> in 2003. The next year, Williams decided to establish <term class="no-emphasis">Odeo</term>, a platform for creating and sharing podcasts. <term class="no-emphasis">Apple</term> had been working on a similar platform and shared it earlier on <term class="no-emphasis">iTunes</term> to the demise of Odeo. Williams didn’t want to go head to head with iTunes, as this could potentially destroy his company, so he found a way to go in a different direction and establish a new way of sharing status updates and other data. Williams took that failure, and with a few friends, co-founded <term class="no-emphasis">Twitter</term>. We all know how that worked out: Twitter is one of the most popular microblogging tech platforms.<footnote id="fs-idm244147232">Paige Cooper. “28 Twitter Statistics All Marketers Need to Know in 2019.” <emphasis effect="italics">Hootsuite</emphasis>.

<para id="fs-idm247500928">Kathryn <term class="no-emphasis">Minshew</term>, shown in <link target-id="OSX_Eship_10_02_KMinshew"/>, also experienced failure but has learned from it. In 2010, she quit her job to create <term class="no-emphasis">Pretty Young Professionals (PYP)</term>. She invested $25,000 of her own money to develop a networking platform for women who were smart and passionate about their careers. After a few months, she and the three other co-founders started to disagree on some issues, including their approach to advertising. As they hadn’t completely formalized the ownership of PYP, two of the founders lost their investments, including Minshew. After experiencing the loss of her investment, her friendships, and the original idea, Minshew persevered with a new opportunity and established <term class="no-emphasis">The Muse</term>. This platform is similar to PYP but added job listings, workshops, and advice. Currently, the site has over 4 million users and is a major competitor of <term class="no-emphasis">LinkedIn</term>. Minshew didn’t let her first disappointment prevent her from starting a new venture. She applied the lessons learned in building the original platform to the creation of a new one—with the right contracts and right people in place.<footnote id="fs-idm243120608">Doria Lavagnino. “Muse CEO and Co-Founder Kathryn Minshew: Journey of an Entrepreneur.” <emphasis effect="italics">Centasi</emphasis>.

<para id="fs-idm219953136">Being able to learn from different types of failure is as important as experiencing success because you get to know your strengths and how to leverage them. Failures can be seen as stepping stones rather than embarrassments. Feeling comfortable takes practice. <link target-id="fs-idm239190176"/> shares several tips on dealing with these dynamics.</para>

<title>Coping with Fear</title>
<para id="fs-idm207976944">When coping with <term class="no-emphasis">fear of failure</term>, there are two strategies that entrepreneurs can use. The first way to reduce fear of failure is to modify your business strategy by changing the target outcomes for your business. Instead of aiming to make $50,000 in the first six months, you can be open to the idea of a leaner start, learning about your customers and how best to serve them. Learning/growth goals can be just as valuable as hitting a revenue target in terms of overall success and longevity. Also, if a goal is not met, don’t consider it a total failure: Refocus and ask yourself what you learned from the experience and how to apply that knowledge to a revised goal. More than likely you will find this experience has enhanced your toolbox to help you make changes within the business or start a new one.</para>
<para id="fs-idm232466016">A second way to reduce high stress is to practice some sort of meditation or breathing exercise that can help lower the anxiety created by fearful thinking. Reaching out to a mentor, support group, therapist, or counselor can also help alleviate fearful thinking.</para>

<title>Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idm220133568">Failure is common in business creation, especially in the early stages. Only a small percentage of ventures make it to the two-, five-, and ten-year mark. Common reasons for this include mistakes and missed opportunities in marketing, financing, management, and innovation. However, there are steps the owner can take, such as making sure they are targeting the right customer, ensuring proper finances are in place to operate and grow the business, creating contracts when sharing the business with stakeholders, and innovating when needed. Fear of failure is also a major contributor to business failure. Some suggestions to manage fear include adjusting expectations and asking for help.</para>
