<para id="fs-idm493313152">In 2015, Doug <term class="no-emphasis">Monahan</term>, the CEO and founder of <term class="no-emphasis">iBackPack</term> of Texas, Inc., introduced a revolutionary technology package encased in a typical backpack. The iBackPack boasted the capacity to incorporate WiFi/MiFi, a battery system, smart power transfer cables, and a car-charging system—while carrying four notebook computers and their accessories. Monahan promised that the iBackPack would be a “communication hub and corresponding electrical powerhouse for students and business professionals alike.”<footnote id="fs-idm171008480">“iBackPack Planning Kickstarter Launch on Black Friday.” <emphasis effect="italics">Cision PR Newswire</emphasis>.

<para id="fs-idm222503088">In 2016, iBackPack raised over $800,000 to fulfill investors’ orders, but the product never materialized. The only update from the company was a Facebook post alluding to issues sourcing “safe” batteries. By 2017, the iBackPack crowdfunding campaign failed to deliver the product promised to its investors.<footnote id="fs-idm174517792">Lewis Leong. “Sorry, iBackPack Backers.
